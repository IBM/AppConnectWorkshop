# Building Integrations with App Connect 

[IBMÂ® App Connect](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/app-connect) instantly connects applications and data from existing systems and modern technologies across all environments. You can use App Connect to create event-driven flows or flows for APIs. 

### Event Driven Flows: 
In an event-driven flow, you identify an event that can occur in your first application (the source application), and actions that can be performed in one or more target applications. The flow links the event to the actions so that, whenever the event occurs in the source application, the action is automatically triggered in the target applications.

For example, you might create a flow so that whenever someone registers as a new attendee with Eventbrite (the event), App Connect automatically retrieves details of the attendee from Salesforce and creates a task in Asana (the actions).

### Flows for API:
A flow for an API contains a request, one or more target application actions, and a response. The request uses a model that you define to request the creation, replacement, or retrieval of data objects in your applications. When the request is submitted, each target application performs its action. The flow then returns a response that either confirms that the actions were successful, or returns the data that was requested.
